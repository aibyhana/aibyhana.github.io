I hold an MSc in Data Science with a focus on Machine Learning and AI, along with a BSc in Business Informatics. My experience spans industry and research—from developing forecasting models at BMW Group to implementing ethical AI frameworks as a NeurIPS reviewer.

I specialize in applied ML solutions for real-world challenges, with a keen interest in `trustworthy AI` and `multimodal systems`. Whether optimizing supply chains or bridging the gap between data and decisions, I’m driven by impactful, scalable results.

Let’s build something meaningful.
