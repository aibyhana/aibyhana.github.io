My goal is to make AI systems more reliable, interpretable, and secure, both in research and real-world applications. I am interested in understanding exactly how AI models operate in order to make AI more reliable for everyone. 

I hold an MSc in Data Science with a specialization in Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, along with a BSc in Business Informatics. My recent research work spans mechanistic interpretability, red teaming, and multimodal AI, bridging theory with practical impact.
