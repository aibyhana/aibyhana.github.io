Hello, I'm a Data Scientist and AI Researcher with an MSc in Data Science, specializing in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and a BSc in Business Informatics. During my master's studies, I gained hands-on experience as a working student Data Scientist at Siemens Healthineers and Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, and interned in Data Analytics & AI for Production at BMW Group.

My work focuses on `applied machine learning in industry`, with a strong interest in `trustworthy AI`. I previously served as an AI Ethics Reviewer at NeurIPS and regularly participate in machine learning competitions to improve my expertise in `multimodal machine learning`.



Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
