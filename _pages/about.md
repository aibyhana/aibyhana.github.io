I'm an AI researcher dedicated to making AI systems safer and more transparent. My work is driven by this question: how do AI models really work? By investigating their internal mechanics, I develop solutions that make them more interpretable and secure for everyone.

I'm interested in mechanistic interpretability and adversarial red teaming. Previously, I graduated with an MSc in Data Science (specializing in ML/AI) and a BSc in Business Informatics.
